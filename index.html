                    <h3>A Little Background...</h3>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've had a fascination with things and their inner workings. From a young age my parents would
                        chatch me dissasembling flashlights and other junk in my bedroom. As I see it, this fascination pushed me to understand how the
                        world works, but more improtatntly it pushed me to imagine and actualize ideas of my own. I have always gravitated toward 
                        learning any skill or technique that would allow me to bring something from my imagination into reality, whether it's drawing,
                        painting, woodworking, sculpting, electronics, or even coding. Creating and building will always be my passions, whatever
                        the medium I'm working in. Considering that the web is the most powerful and pervasive medium of our time, I couldn't resist
                        learning the tools to manipulate it to my vision!</p>
